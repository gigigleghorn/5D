			   On campus, a work can be seen that looks suspiciously like a Banksy. A street artist from the United Kingdom, Banksy is anonymous. So therefore, he could be in Boston and he could (or she) could have created this little piece. Banksy is famous for being a political activist and graffiti artist although now his work is being picked up and put in museums. A few years back, one of his pieces of a girl and a balloon was sold at a Sotheby’s auction. It famously shredded itself right after it sold. Upon further investigation into this little gem that we have the privileged to have on our campus, I found out the piece was done by a French artist, Jef Aerosol. He was asked to create multiple pieces all around the campus as part of Northeastern’s art initiative. All his pieces are black and white, as this one is. But, I think imagination is key in life so I will pretend I never did any research and let the mystery stay.
